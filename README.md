# Make it Cheaper technical test

This application has a form that conforms to some validation methodology. It explores what's wrong with the form when trying to send it, or every time one of the fields change.

On sending axios is meant to post the data to the restAPI. At the moment I'm getting a 405 from the api even though I'm entering the authorisation string after the given url for the API. This can be easily corrected and will get back to this but for now this is a first draft of the code.
